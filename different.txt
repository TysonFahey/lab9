JavaScript is a language, Vue.js is a framework that is built on top of JavaScript. Vue.js can utalize JavaScript's features and simplify the development process. If we make the comparison to painting, JavaScript is like creating the paint from scratch and Vue.js is utalizing the paint already made by JavaScript and simplifying its application to the canvas. I prefer Vue.js simply because it is simplify the process. I like the feature of changing data live without having to refresh your page. Rather than hoping you don't get an error message, you can see in real time if what you are changing is even registering in the first place. I find that exciting and helpful.
